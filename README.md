House Price Prediction Model

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Model repository! üéâ
This project was developed to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in a specific region by analyzing various socio-economic and geographical factors. It provides users with a simple, intuitive interface to input key property details, and outputs a prediction of the house price based on the trained model.

üìÑ Project Overview
This project uses a Machine Learning algorithm to estimate house prices by analyzing 13 crucial variables such as crime rate, pupil-teacher ratio, proximity to employment centers, and more. The goal is to provide accurate, data-driven predictions for the real estate industry and help users make informed decisions.

üéØ Client Requirements
The client requested a web-based application that:

Predicts house prices based on real estate, environmental, and socio-economic factors.
Is user-friendly, with a clean and modern design.
Provides accurate predictions using historical data.

‚ú® Key Features Implemented
User Interface (UI) Design
Developed a modern, clean, and intuitive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The form allows users to input 13 critical property-related parameters such as crime rate, distance to employment centers, and nitric oxide concentration.
Input Fields & Variables
Each input field is mapped to a significant factor in predicting house prices:

CRIM: Crime rate per capita by town.

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise).

NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.

DIS: Weighted distance to Boston employment centers.

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.

TAX: Property tax rate per $10,000.

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.

B: Proportion of African American population.

LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population.

Backend Development

Built using Python and Flask to handle form submission and process predictions.
The machine learning model is trained on historical housing data to generate accurate predictions based on the input parameters.

üîç Prediction Accuracy

The model was trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, a popular dataset for regression tasks.
Thorough testing and validation were performed to ensure the model accurately predicts house prices based on real-world data.

üõ† Technologies Used

Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for a sleek and responsive user interface.
Back-End: Python and Flask to handle the machine learning model and manage requests.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for training the prediction model.
Data Handling: Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.
Optional Visualization: Matplotlib for visualizing the data (expandable based on client preference).

üìä Example Predictions

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of some prediction examples based on different input values:

CRIM	ZN	INDUS	RM	TAX	PTRATIO	Predicted Price
0.03	25	5.19	6.5	300	15.3	$21,417
0.15	0	10.3	5.7	320	18.9	$18,900

üìà Future Improvements

This project is open for enhancements! Here are some ideas for future improvements:

Feature Scaling: Implement advanced scaling techniques for more precise predictions.

Additional Datasets: Integrate other real estate datasets to enhance the model's generalization capability.

Visualization: Include more data visualization tools to provide users with deeper insights into housing trends.

üèÜ Conclusion

This project successfully delivers an accurate and user-friendly House Price Prediction model, meeting client requirements while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface. With 13 key variables, the model ensures precise predictions for house prices, and can be further extended with additional analytics and visualization features.
