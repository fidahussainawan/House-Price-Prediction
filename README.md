Project Title: House Price Prediction Model
Project Overview:
The House Price Prediction model is developed to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in a specific region based on several critical socio-economic and geographical factors. The model leverages a machine learning algorithm to analyze these factors and generate a price estimate. The user inputs relevant data through a form, and the model predicts the house price based on the trained dataset.

Client Requirements:
The client requested a web-based application that predicts house prices using key real estate and environmental factors such as crime rates, proximity to employment, property tax rates, and environmental conditions. The application needed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and accurate in its predictions.

Key Features Implemented:
User Interface (UI) Design:

A modern, clean, and intuitive UI was created using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The form allows the user to input 13 critical parameters related to the property and its surroundings, including crime rate, nitric oxide concentration, and pupil-teacher ratio.
Input Fields & Variables: Each input field in the form corresponds to one of the following important factors in predicting house prices:

CRIM (Crime Rate): Per capita crime rate by town.
ZN (Residential Land %): Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
INDUS (Non-Retail Business %): Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS (Charles River): A dummy variable indicating whether the property bounds the Charles River (1 for yes, 0 for no).
NOX (Nitric Oxides Concentration): Nitric oxide concentration (in parts per 10 million).
RM (Avg. Rooms/Dwelling): The average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE (Older Units %): Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
DIS (Distance to Employment): Weighted distances to the five Boston employment centers.
RAD (Highway Access): Index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX (Property Tax Rate): Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
PTRATIO (Pupil-Teacher Ratio): Ratio of students to teachers in local schools.
B (African American Proportion): 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of African Americans by town.
LSTAT (Lower Status Population %): Percentage of the population classified as lower status.
Backend Development:

The model uses a Machine Learning algorithm trained on historical housing data. It is built using Python and the Flask framework.
The backend calculates house price predictions using the above factors and displays the predicted house price to the user.
Prediction Accuracy:

The model was trained on the Boston Housing Dataset to learn the relationship between property characteristics and house prices. This dataset is widely used for regression tasks and includes all the necessary fields to predict house prices.
Testing and validation were performed to ensure the model's prediction accuracy aligns with real-world data.
Technologies Used:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Back-End: Python, Flask
Machine Learning Model: Scikit-learn for model building and training.
Data Handling: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Visualization: Matplotlib for data visualizations (optional, depending on client preference).
Conclusion:
This project fulfills the client's requirement by providing a robust and accurate prediction model, a user-friendly interface, and clean, professional visual elements. The combination of socio-economic, geographical, and demographic factors ensures that the house price predictions are grounded in real-world data. The tool can be further expanded to include additional predictive analytics and enhanced visualizations as required.
